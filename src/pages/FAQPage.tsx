      question: 'How often should I visit the dentist?',

    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: 'At what age should my child first see a dentist?',

    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: 'What should I do in a dental emergency?',
      answer: 'For any dental emergency, contact our office immediately. For a knocked-out tooth, keep it moist in milk or between your cheek and gums (if possible) and come in right away. For severe pain, broken teeth, or dental trauma, we offer same-day emergency appointments.',

      question: 'How long do dental implants last?',
      answer: 'With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last a lifetime. The crown portion typically lasts 10-15 years before it might need replacement due to normal wear and tear. Regular dental check-ups and good oral hygiene are essential for the longevity of your implants.',
      category: 'Procedures',
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: 'Is teeth whitening safe?',
      answer: 'Professional teeth whitening supervised by a dentist is safe for most patients.

Some patients may experience temporary sensitivity, which typically resolves quickly.',

    {
      id: 9,
      question: 'How long will my appointment take?',

      question: 'Why are X-rays necessary?',
      answer: 'Dental X-rays allow us to see problems that aren\'t visible during a visual examination, such as decay between teeth, issues below the gum line, and bone loss. We use digital X-rays, which emit up to 90% less radiation than traditional X-rays and provide highly detailed images.',
      category: 'Procedures',
    },
    {
      id: 11,
      question: 'How can I prevent cavities?',
      answer: 'Preventing cavities involves a combination of good home care and regular professional cleanings.

      id: 12,
      question: 'What causes bad breath and how can I prevent it?',
      answer: 'Bad breath (halitosis) can be caused by poor oral hygiene, gum disease, dry mouth, certain foods, tobacco use, or underlying health conditions. To prevent bad breath, brush and floss regularly, clean your tongue, stay hydrated, avoid tobacco, and visit us for regular cleanings. If persistent, it might indicate a more serious condition that needs attention.',

      question: 'Is it normal for my gums to bleed when I brush?',
